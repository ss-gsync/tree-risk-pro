# ML Model In-Memory Service Implementation (v0.2.3)

We've implemented a new in-memory service for faster ML inference in the dashboard. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Backend Changes

1. Created a new MLModelService class in /ttt/tree_ml/dashboard/backend/services/ml/model_service.py
   - Loads DeepForest and SAM models once during initialization
   - Keeps models in memory for fast inference
   - Provides methods for detection and segmentation
   - Generates combined visualizations

2. Updated DetectionService in detection_service.py
   - Added support for in-memory model service
   - Improved segmentation with batch processing
   - Added combined visualization generation

3. Added new API endpoints
   - /api/ml/status - Get ML model status
   - Updated root endpoint to show ML model status
   - Updated config endpoint to include ML model status

## Frontend Changes

1. Updated TreeDetection.jsx component
   - Added segmentation option
   - Added visualization display
   - Updated event handling to include visualization path

2. Updated apiService.js
   - Added support for segmentation and in-memory service flags
   - Added MLModelService with getModelStatus method
   - Updated treeDetectionResult event to include visualization path

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server
2. Open the dashboard
3. Go to the Tree Detection panel
4. Check the 'Use tree segmentation' option
5. Run detection
6. View the combined visualization in the results

## Performance Improvements

- Model loading happens once at startup instead of for each request
- Segmentation is performed in batch for all trees
- Combined visualization is generated on the server
- The same model instance is reused for all requests
